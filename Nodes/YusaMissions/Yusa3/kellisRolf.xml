My name is Rolf Burgundy, I am the head of the Kellis Biotech maintenance team for KBT Pacemakers.
For the five years I've worked at Kellis Biotech, I've made it my mission to make sure no KBT Pacemaker has failed on a patient. This has been met with overwhelming success for the most part, save for one incident a year back.
