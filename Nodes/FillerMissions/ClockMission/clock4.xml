<note>Trial End
Riddle me do, riddle me dee, the final IP comes in a riddle for thee.
The first one is the number of times
"riddle" was uttered in this little rhyme
The second is the number of letters
In total from the walls of fire
(Did you remember them? Well, you better!)
Third may give your brain a tire,
But worry not, for it is not dire.
'Tis the beginning of the end, the end of every place.
'Tis the beginning of eternity, the end of time and space.
The final one is not so tricky,
In fact, I'd say it's quite a quicky.
Excluding this phone, in this little trial,
How many ordeals did I give you (in style)?
Put them together and what do you get?
A reward, that's what! And don't you forget!</note>
