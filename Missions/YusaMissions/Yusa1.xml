<body>Thank you for doing this, #PLAYERNAME#.
This is a hard for me to put into words, but I think I trust you enough to tell you the situation.
My brother is in the hospital being treated for an accident that happened about a year ago. He's been in there for such a long time, when I contacted the hospital they said he was stable with his pacemaker, but they didn't have the resources to keep him like that for much longer.
I've been trying to find something that might be able to keep him stable indefinitely, at least until they can treat him properly.
I've been looking into various things and found something about a biotech company that may just have what I need.
Please, #PLAYERNAME#, can you help me look into this?
If you find anything, like research notes or something, please upload them to a server I'll link you to.
I'll be in your care,
-Yusa</body>
