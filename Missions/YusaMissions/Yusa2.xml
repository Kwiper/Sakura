<body>I've been looking more into what could save my brother.
Kellis Biotech was probably the best place to look for something to save him. And I think there could be more to find.
If we can find evidence of a prototype that could save him, that would mean the world to me.
Please help me with this, #PLAYERNAME#. If you find anything, upload it to my drop server.
