<body>You know how I said I was off the grid in Pacific Air's eyes?
Ehehe, well, that's not entirely true. Turns out Pacific Air wasn't the only one keeping an eye on my... activities.
There's this group called Psylance. They deal with cybersecurity and whatnot. I thought they had been silenced by one of my colleagues from Bibliotheque, but nope.
I'm gonna have you go through Pacific Air one more time to get to Psylance.
Once you get in, delete all traces of Coel from Psylance's servers.
Good luck!
