<body>Glad you're helping me with this, #PLAYERNAME#!
So you know how a while back, like a year ago, I suddenly went off and joined some group and ran into a bit of trouble? Yeah, well, that's coming back and biting me in the ass.
Part of what happened involved some shenanigans with an airport. I think there are still records of my activity there.
I need help getting into the airport systems and deleting all traces of Coel, AKA me!
Thanks for the help!
