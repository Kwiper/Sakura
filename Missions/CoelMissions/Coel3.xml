<body>I'm now safe from the eyes of Pacific Air and Psylance.
There's one more place we have to hit before I'm completely scott-free. The American government.
Obviously, this one's more risky because if we get caught, well let's just say the punishment's gonna be a bit more severe.
Get into the White House's network and delete all traces of Coel.
Good luck,
