<body>This one's a bit more on the illegal side. It's time to rob a bank!
Well, not really. A client wants us to find the bank account number of a man named Alex Broodman. Sounds simple enough.
I'll link you to the bank's account management. The client did the hard part for us. All you have to do is find the bank account number of a man named Alex Broodman and attach it here.
Have fun,
