<body>Alrighty, #PLAYERNAME#.
For this one, looks like you're gonna be giving someone a university degree. The client's name is Mei Hakuno. She's a student of engineering at Yuuei Academy.
She has requested that you give her a Masters in Engineering from Yuuei Academy, with a GPA of 3.0. Sounds simple enough.
I'll link you to the academic archive as well as Mei's computer.
Have fun,
