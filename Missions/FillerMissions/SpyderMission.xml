<body>Mission number one is a go, #PLAYERNAME#.
Somebody wants some spyware uploaded onto another person's computer. Unfortunately, I don't carry around any spare spyware. Luckily, I know a place that creates programs like what we use to hack into computers.
I'll link you to both the target and the repository where the goods are kept. Once you get the spyware, you should upload it to the target's /sys folder.
Good luck,
-Coel</body>
