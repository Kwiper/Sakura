<body>Thanks for joining me on this bout.
Last time, an IP was found. Upon further investigation, this IP led me to the next clue as to Shou Makise's whereabouts.
Problem is, I can't go about this alone. I need your help in investigating this second clue.
I believe I'm getting closer to finding him. If you can find any other important IPs regarding Shou Makise, please let me know.
I'm counting on you,
-Kurisu</body>
