<body>I never expected you to do this with me, #PLAYERNAME#. I'm thankful for the help.
Over the past few months, I've been investigating someone from my past. His name is Shou Makise.
I've been tracking him down. I need help in finding him.
I'll link you to the last place I could track him at, from about a year ago.
If you find anything, like an IP, please let me know.
