<body>I believe this is the final stretch in finding Shou Makise.
The last clue led to a place called Future Foundation. It's a tech company, much like what Zern and Mirai were before it.
There's a pattern here. I believe Future Foundation holds the last piece of the puzzle surrounding him.
If you can find any files about Shou Makise, please send them to me.
